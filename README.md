# rvmeter-client
Client implementation for the RV Meter

The rvmeter consists of the [rvmeter-server](https://github.com/goneall/rvmeter-server) software running on an ESP-32 and this client software which runs on a phone.

The current implementation has been tested on Android, but could / should work on an iPhone.

## Usage

After installation, select the "scan" button to scan for nearby servers.  Once a server is connetected, it will need to be calibrated for the water holding tank (the scale icon in the upper right-hand corner).


After calibration, the water and battery level will show on the app.
